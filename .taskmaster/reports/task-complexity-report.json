			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand on the implementation details for the remaining pending subtasks of Task 7: Overlap-Add refinement, advanced window function optimization for artifact reduction, and the design of the real-time streaming buffer management system. Focus on specific algorithms, data structures, and integration points with the existing `PbPSynthesisEngine`.",
			"reasoning": "The core PbP algorithm (7.1) and FFT integration (7.2) are already completed and functional, as evidenced by the existing `pbp_synthesis_engine.h/.cpp` and `fft_transform_manager.h/.cpp` files. The `PbPSynthesisEngine` already contains members and helper functions for overlap-add (`m_overlapBuffer`, `applyWindowAndOverlapAdd`) and window functions (`WindowFunctionType`, `generateWindow`). Therefore, the remaining subtasks (7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6) are primarily about refinement, optimization, and building higher-level architectural components (real-time streaming, external quality/performance tools). This makes it a medium-high complexity task, as it's not greenfield but requires significant work on numerical stability, artifact reduction research, and new system design."

			"taskTitle": "통합 테스트 및 성능 벤치마크 구현",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation plan for Task 10, focusing on setting up the end-to-end integration test suite, designing the A/B quality comparison framework against `moresampler` (including metrics and comparison methodology), and outlining the steps for configuring a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and benchmarking.",
			"reasoning": "While basic unit tests exist (`test_pbp_synthesis_engine.cpp`, `test_fft_performance.cpp`), this task requires comprehensive end-to-end integration testing, which is largely greenfield. Implementing A/B quality comparison against an external tool like `moresampler` involves developing custom audio analysis tools and metrics. Furthermore, setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and performance regression prevention is a significant undertaking, often involving external configuration and scripting beyond the C++ codebase itself. This breadth and the need for external tool integration contribute to its high complexity."

			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "보이스뱅크 컨디셔닝 도구 구현",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the detailed implementation steps for Task 9, including the design of the `.nvm` file format (considering binary vs. JSON, and data structure for F0/SP/AP), the strategy for parsing UTAU `oto.ini` files, and the workflow for converting WAV files to pre-processed data, integrating with the existing WORLD parameter extraction module.",
			"reasoning": "This task is largely greenfield development. It requires designing and implementing a new `.nvm` file format from scratch, parsing the complex and often undocumented `oto.ini` metadata used by UTAU voicebanks, and orchestrating the conversion process. This involves file I/O, directory scanning, and integrating with the existing WORLD parameter extraction (Task 2) to pre-process audio data. The need to define a new data model and parse an external, specific format makes this a high-complexity task."

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "UTAU 리샘플러 인터페이스 구현",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Provide a detailed implementation plan for Task 8, focusing on the precise parsing of UTAU's `moresampler`-compatible command-line arguments (including various flags like -g, -t, -o, -s), the algorithms for transforming these UTAU parameters into F0, SP, and AP modifications suitable for the PbP synthesis engine, and the overall orchestration of the synthesis pipeline from input WAV to output WAV, ensuring Windows compatibility and robust error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This is a very high-complexity task due to its critical role as the user-facing interface for UTAU. It requires meticulous command-line argument parsing to achieve 100% compatibility with `moresampler`, which has many specific and often non-obvious flag behaviors. The most challenging aspect is implementing the intricate logic to translate UTAU's high-level flags (e.g., pitch, tempo, gender, vibrato) into precise modifications of the low-level F0, SP, and AP parameters required by the PbP synthesis engine. This demands deep knowledge of both UTAU's internal workings and speech synthesis principles. The entire synthesis pipeline must be orchestrated, along with robust error handling and Windows-specific compatibility considerations."
